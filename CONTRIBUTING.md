Welcome!

Our project is small, so we're happy to receive feedback and bug reports via Github issues. @apike or @brendanlensink will work to triage and respond. You can also email us, contact@steamclock.com.

If you'd like to submit a pull request that doesn't fix something there's already an open issue for, it's probably best to start with filing an issue about what change you'd like to make.
