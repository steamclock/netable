Welcome!

Our project is small, so we're happy to receive feedback and bug reports via Github issues. @apike or @brendanlensink will work to triage and respond. You can also email us, contact@steamclock.com.

If you'd like to submit a pull request that doesn't fix something there's already an open issue for, it's probably best to start with filing an issue about what change you'd like to make.

It's worth keeping in mind that automated testing for Bluetooth operations is a lot harder than most other types of functionality. We have some ideas for how do better automated and semi-automated testing, but in the meantime it would be ideal if inbound changes had a plan for how to manually test the functionality.
